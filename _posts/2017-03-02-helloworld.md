Hi I'm Schwarz, Mike Schwarz, and this is the first post in my new blog!

## Who?

I'm currently an Economist with the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and have been for the past 5 years.  I have a Bachelors in Economics from Salisbury University, and at some point in my life I hope to pursue a masters. I am married to my amazing wife Gillian, and we have the most adorable daughter Eleanor "Ellie". In my free time I enjoy playing beach volleyball, reading (huge history nerd).  I'm also a James Bond and Star Trek fan, and I'm convinced those two go together, don't argue.  

## What?

I'm going to primarily use this blog to showcase my interest in data science. I specialize in workplace injuries and illnesses, so a large percent of posts will focus on that topic, but I will also try and sprinkle in some other EDA projects.  I just read an article today in the Washington Post about how Ayn Rand's influence has peaked, that's basically the argument.  I think it would be interesting to actually measure the modern day influence of political and economic authors.  Unfortunately book sales data isn't widely available, so this would take some creativity.  

## Why?

Basically, think Freakonomics done with R and Shiny.  Speaking of which, my [Shiny Server](https://www.mschwarz.us/shiny/) is where I will showcase some of the apps I've built.  I'm also a huge fan of open source, and I want to give a shout out to [Dean Attali](http://http://deanattali.com/).  I'm never met Dean, or even spoken to him, but his github page is fantastic, and I've taking inspiration from his work as the basis for this blog.  I'm also using his theme "Beautiful Jekyll" as the back end for this site. I'll be doing a blog in the future about how exactly I've set this site up, because I like to use R Studio and rmd documents there was some slight modifications.  Essentially I love data, and I enjoy sharing my findings and the tools I use and build to do my work. 

# When?

This is purely a hobby.  I'm on no deadlines or pressure from anyone by myself.  If there are stretches where I don't get anything up, don't panic, I'm probably busy playing with my daughter.  We all have priorities right?  


# Anything else?

That's pretty much it.  If you have any suggestions for topics shoot me a message.
